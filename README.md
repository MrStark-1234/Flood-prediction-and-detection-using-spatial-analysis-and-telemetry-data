This project is a web-based application designed to predict and detect floods safety in various cities based on weather data. 

The prediction model works using an LSTM-RNN model ,a datastet containing 20 parameters with 10,00,000 rows and plotlify js.
The real time detection model works using a CNN model, real time weatehr data from visual weather cross api and google maps api.

To run the project:
1. Clone this repository
2. add visual weather cross api and google maps api in .env file in root directory.
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python app.py
